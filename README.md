# tJOG
the joy of gpx - gpx analysis tools, written in python

Im planning to wrap a lot of functionality into this project, so expect parameters etc. to undergo breaking changes every now and then

```
usage : tJOG.py [-h] [-ADL] <inputfile>
    -h : (optional) display help
    -ADL : (optional) set the origin to the city centre of Adelaide (Australia, South Australia)
    
    The output file tJOG_<inputfile> is created, with origin removed/replaced
    
    e.g. tJOG.py -ADL test.gpx
```
